# Virtualization-Lab

This objective of this project is to demystify virtualization concepts such as virtual machine, virtual CPU and so on to curious individuals with KVM.

The project is composed of 2 labs with different goals:
* **Lab1** -- Creating and deploying a simple virtual machine.
* **Lab2** -- Running a C application inside a virtual machine and handling the VM exits.
* **Lab3** -- Implementing the cold migration mechanism.

Each lab contains an intruction file (INSTRUCTION.md)
The labs 1 & 2 contains also their corrections (CORRECTION.md).
